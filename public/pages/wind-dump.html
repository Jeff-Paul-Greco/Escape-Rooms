Read the following articles to find out which device you can make with what you have. These articles were given to you by your cousin, Geoffrey and he will not tell you what you are making until you decipher the code that he has embedded in each article. Based on the tools specified in the different articles, decide which article you are going to use to build your device and then decipher the code contained in that article. Hint: Geoffrey really loves color!
