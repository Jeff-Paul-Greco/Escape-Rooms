                            Now it’s time to make a blueprint. In order to make this blueprint, it is important to be
                            good at drawing inferences. Your uncle, Socrates gives you a traditional fable to read and
                            tells you that he will quiz you on it to test your skills of inference. That way, you can be
                            sure that you are prepared to create your blueprint!

                            Dad, “That is a new record for me!” Then she went to search for more flat stones.

                            It is a bright, sunny day. Tasha is wearing a new skirt. Her new, blue backpack is full of the school supplies that her mother bought last week. Tasha is feeling excited and a little nervous.

                            Robbie excitedly tore the bright red wrapping paper off the box. Instead of the science kit he had been hoping for, he saw that the box was not big enough for his science kit. He took off the lid to find a brown sweater inside.
