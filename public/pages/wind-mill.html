                            Now it’s time to make a blueprint. In order to make this blueprint, it is important to be
                            good at drawing inferences. Your uncle, Socrates gives you a traditional fable to read and
                            tells you that he will quiz you on it to test your skills of inference. That way, you can be
                            sure that you are prepared to create your blueprint!

                            Maria threw the flat stone toward the lake. “One, two, three, four, five!” she called to her
                            Dad, “That is a new record for me!” Then she went to search for more flat stones.

                            It is a bright, sunny day. Tasha is wearing a new skirt. Her new, blue backpack is full of the school supplies that her mother bought last week. Tasha is feeling excited and a little nervous.

                        <p>What day is it?</p>

                            Robbie excitedly tore the bright red wrapping paper off the box. Instead of the science kit he had been hoping for, he saw that the box was not big enough for his science kit. He took off the lid to find a brown sweater inside.

                            “Here kitty, kitty,” called Zoe softly. The cat meowed, but refused to come closer. Zoe grabbed onto a sturdy branch above her head and climbed a little closer.

                            Kylie woke up feeling itchy and hot. There were little red spots all over her body. “No school for you” said mom. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Why isn’t Kylie going to school?</p>

                            Lauren woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of crying. She heard her mother’s soft footsteps in the hall. Soon the house was quiet again. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Who was crying?</p>

                            “Down boy!” said Jeff, laughing as he tried to calm his slobbering pet. “We’ll go for a walk in a minute.”
                        </p>
                        <p>What kind of pet does Jeff have?</p>
