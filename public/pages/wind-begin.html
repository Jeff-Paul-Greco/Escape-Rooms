                            <option value="1">When William Kamkwamba was growing up in Masitala, a farming village of
                                about 60 families in Malawi, the best day of the year was Christmas. Then, he, his
                                parents, and his six sisters ate meat with their usual maize porridge and greens.

                            <option value="2">But, between 2001 and 2006, drought and famine hit Malawi. Even maize
                                withered and blew away. Limited to one tiny meal a day, the Kamkwambas starved...His
                                family was desolate. If only he could help.
                            </option>
                            <option value="3">During the rainy season, young William hunted for birds, using traps he
                                fashioned from a hoe, a scarf, bicycle tires, bricks, his mother’s clothesline, and
                                ropes made of blue gum tree bark. With his ingenuity and steady hand, William brought
                                home meat.

                            <option value="1">“Of course, he thought. This is how spinning motion generates power!”
                                William wrote in his book The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. And power could provide
                                lighting and move water from the stream to fields. Studying a book on energy, William
                                realized wind could power pumps better than bicycling! All he needed to do was build a
                                windmill.
                            </option>
                            <option value="2">William headed to the library, a small room with three walls of books from
                                America and electric lights. Although he knew little English, he figured out from
                                diagrams how water wheels and electromagnets produce electricity; how batteries yield
                                direct current; how magnets concocted from everyday objects make alternating current.

                            <option value="3">A natural mechanic, William powered a radio by connecting one to the
                                dynamo on a bicycle. While he pedaled, his cousin Geoffrey danced to African reggae
                                music.

                            <option value="3">This one required heavier materials—a tractor fan, shock absorber, vats of
                                grease—which William scrounged from a scrap yard.
                                Months later, he had finally collected all the pieces—except the dynamo he needed for a
                                generator. Then, a friend, Gilbert Wimbe, son of Masitala’s chief, gave him 200 kwacha
                                to buy one. The next day, he started connecting the parts.

Bryan Mealer, the co-author of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, says William’s message “really resonated with a lot of people.” Thanks to William’s windmill, change is in the air for the people of Malawi.
