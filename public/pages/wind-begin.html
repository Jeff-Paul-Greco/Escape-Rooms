                    <p id="q1">When William Kamkwamba was growing up in Masitala, a farming village of
                        about 60 families in Malawi, the best day of the year was Christmas. Then, he, his
                        parents, and his six sisters ate meat with their usual maize porridge and greens.

                        William wrote in his book The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. And power could provide
                        lighting and move water from the stream to fields. Studying a book on energy, William
                        realized wind could power pumps better than bicycling! All he needed to do was build a
                        windmill.

                        community committee that helps to regulate the price of food resources during drought times.
